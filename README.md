### Brief: 
This analysis explores transaction activites that can easily be ignored my card owners as little or nothing.  Actually this transactions represent fraudlent transactions, but because they are little amounts and carried out around certain hours of the day are ignored by card owners.

The AdventureWorks databases are sample databases that were originally published by Microsoft to show how to design a SQL Server database using SQL Server 2008.
